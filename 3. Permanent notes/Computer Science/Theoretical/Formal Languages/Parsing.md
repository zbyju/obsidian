**Parsing** is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages, or data structures.
- **Input**: A string $w$ from the set of terminal symbols $T^âˆ—$.
- **Output**: The syntactic structure of the string, often represented as a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST).
- **Types of Parsing**:
    - **Top-Down parsing**: First looks at the top of the parse trees and works downwards.
    - **Bottom-Up parsing**: Recognizes the lowest-level details and works upwards through mid-level structures to the overall structure.

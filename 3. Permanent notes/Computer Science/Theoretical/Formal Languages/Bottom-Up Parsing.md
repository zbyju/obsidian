**Bottom-up Parsing** is a strategy where the parser starts from the input symbols and works its way up to the start symbol of the grammar.

This approach constructs the parse tree from the leaves (input symbols) to the root (start symbol).

There are levels of expressiveness (bought for computing complexity):
- LR(0)
- SLR(1)
- LALR(1)
- LR(1)

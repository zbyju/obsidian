# Pros
- Easier creation of complex objects
- Reuse same code for different object representations
- [[Single Responsibility Principle]] - Isolate construction to specific classes; let products and client worry about business logic

# Cons
- Increased code complexity
- Can be a problem with static analysis

# Use Cases
- Complex Objects
- Creating classes with same construction steps without them sharing an interface

[[Builder Pattern]]

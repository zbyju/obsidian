"You Aren't Gonna Need It" is a principle that advises against adding functionality until deemed necessary. It's a reminder to avoid overengineering.

# Example
Instead of building a complex configuration system for an application, you'd start with a simple one and only expand when the need arises.

# Description
YAGNI aims to keep the codebase lean, focusing on delivering what's needed now and resisting the temptation to build for perceived future requirements.

# Problems
If we are not following it:
- Delays implementation/releasing new features
- More robust solution is harder to change
- It is more costly to maintain and keep fixing the code if there is more of it

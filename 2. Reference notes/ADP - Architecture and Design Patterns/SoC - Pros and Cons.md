**Pros**:
- Enhances code readability and maintainability.
- Encourages modular design, facilitating code reuse and independent module evolution.
- Simplifies debugging and testing, as issues can be isolated to specific modules.

**Cons**:
- Initial design might be more time-consuming, requiring careful planning.
- Overzealous application can lead to excessive fragmentation, potentially affecting performance.
- Might introduce added complexity due to interfaces or communication between module

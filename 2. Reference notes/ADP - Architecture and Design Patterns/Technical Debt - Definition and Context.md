**Definition**: Technical debt describes the compromises made in software development by selecting quick-and-dirty solutions over the ideal or best ones. Such decisions might speed up the short-term development but could entail more effort in the long run due to maintenance or refactoring.

**Example**: Opting for hard-coded values instead of creating a flexible configuration system because of time constraints.

**Description**: Technical debt isn't always negative. Sometimes, it's a deliberate trade-off made to meet deadlines or other constraints, with the understanding that it will need addressing later.

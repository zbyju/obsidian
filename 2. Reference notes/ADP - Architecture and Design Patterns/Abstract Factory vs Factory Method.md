- Adds creating objects directly to a class with business logic
	- This enhances the possibilities the class can be used
		- Depending on which implementation of the class we use it will operate over different products

# Abstract Factory
- Its only purpose is creating products
- Each factory implementation focuses on creating all product types of a single variant

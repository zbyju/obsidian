**Pros**:
- **Loose Coupling**: Objects are less dependent on the internal structure of other objects, making the system more modular.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Fewer dependencies mean changes in one object have a reduced impact on others.
- **Improved Readability**: Interactions between objects are more straightforward, making the code easier to understand.

**Cons**:
- **Potential Overhead**: There might be cases where adhering strictly to the law requires creating numerous delegate methods, which can be tedious.
- **Over-Application**: Overzealously applying the law can sometimes complicate a design that would otherwise be simpler if direct communication were allowed in specific instances.
- **Misunderstanding the Law**: It's not about reducing method calls but reducing dependencies between objects. Simply chaining fewer methods isn't always the solution.

Premature optimization is optimizing a piece of code before its needed or revealed by benchmarks.

# Example
Optimizing code before analysis (memory usage, profiling).

# Description
Leads to wasted effort, wasted resources, code that is more complex and harder to maintain. It's better to focus on correctness and clarity first, optimize only when the bottlenecks are identified.

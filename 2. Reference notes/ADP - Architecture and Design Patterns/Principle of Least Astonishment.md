The Principle of Least Astonishment (PoLA) in software design means that the outcome of performing an action should be obvious, expected, and consistent.

# Example
If a button in an application says "Save," clicking it should save the data and not perform an unrelated action like "Delete."

# Description
PoLA is about creating intuitive interfaces and behaviors, reducing the learning curve and minimizing potential user errors.
It's also about writing in an idiomatic way - when working with a certain programming language/framework we develop tendencies and habits that we can use and take advantage of both for writing code faster, but also reading.

**Definition**: The Principle of Least Astonishment (PoLA) in software design means that the outcome of performing an action should be obvious, expected, and consistent.

**Example**: If a button in an application says "Save," clicking it should save the data and not perform an unrelated action like "Delete."

**Description**: PoLA is about creating intuitive interfaces and behaviors, reducing the learning curve and minimizing potential user errors.

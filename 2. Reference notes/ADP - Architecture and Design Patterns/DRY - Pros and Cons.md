**Pros**:
- Enhances code maintainability and reduces the risk of introducing errors.
- Encourages modularity, making it easier to understand and extend the codebase.
- Promotes a single source of truth for each piece of knowledge or logic.

**Cons**:
- Overzealous adherence to DRY can lead to overly abstract or complex code.
- Implementing DRY may require additional abstractions or structures, which can introduce complexity.
- Finding the right level of abstraction can be challenging in some cases.

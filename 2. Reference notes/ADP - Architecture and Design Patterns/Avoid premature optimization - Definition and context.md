**Definition**: Premature optimization is optimizing a piece of code before its needed or revealed by benchmarks.

**Example**: Optimizing code before analysis (memory usage, profiling).

**Description**: Leads to wasted effort, code that is more complex and harder to maintain. It's better to focus on correctness and clarity first, optimize only when the bottlenecks are identified.

**Definition**: Premature optimization is optimizing a piece of code before its needed or revealed by benchmarks.

**Example**: Optimizing code before analysis (memory usage, profiling).

**Description**: Leads to wasted effort, increses complexity of the code.
Premature optimization can lead to wasted effort, increased complexity, and decreased code maintainability. It's often best to focus on clarity and correctness first, optimizing only after identifying bottlenecks through profiling.

**Definition**: Premature optimization is the practice of optimizing a software component or system before its performance bottlenecks are well-understood or before such optimization is necessary.

**Example**: Optimizing code for speed or memory usage before profiling reveals that specific sections are performance bottlenecks.

**Description**: Premature optimization can lead to wasted effort, increased complexity, and decreased code maintainability. It's often best to focus on clarity and correctness first, optimizing only after identifying bottlenecks through profiling.

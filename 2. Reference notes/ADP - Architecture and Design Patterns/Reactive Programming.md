It is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and propagation of change. It's possible to express static (e.g. arrays) or dynamic (e.g. event emitters) data streams and communicate their dependencies, which facilitate the propagation of change.

It is based on the [[Observer Pattern]]. Observables can either be hot [[Hot Observable]] or cold [[Cold Observables]].

# Pros
- Isolate code complexity

# Cons
- Facade can become a god object that does everything and connects to every object
	- If this happens consider splitting the facade into multiple facades

# Use Cases
- When we want to provide a simple interface to a complex system
- When there are many dependencies that the client needs to worry about

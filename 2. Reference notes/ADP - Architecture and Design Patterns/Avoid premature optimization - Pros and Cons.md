**Pros**:
- Avoids overcomplicating code prematurely.
- Prioritizes clarity and correctness, making code easier to understand and maintain.
- Prevents wasted effort on optimizations that might not be necessary.

**Cons**:
- May lead to performance bottlenecks being discovered late in development.
- If performance is critical from the start, delaying optimization can be detrimental.
- Can be challenging to strike the right balance between early optimization and premature optimization.

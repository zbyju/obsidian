Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a design principle in software engineering aiming to segregate a program into distinct sections, each handling a specific concern or functionality.

# Example
In web development, the MVC ([[MVC Architecture]]) pattern separates data handling (Model), user interface (View), and business logic (Controller).

# Description
SoC promotes clarity, reusability, and scalability by ensuring that each module or component handles only one aspect of the software's functionality.

**Pros**:
- Better maintainability
- Reducing risk of errors
- Easier refactoring (only need to make the changed in one place)
- Better modularity, easier to extend and understand code

**Cons**:
- Overzealous adherence to DRY can lead to overly abstract or complex code.
- Implementing DRY may require additional abstractions or structures, which can introduce complexity.
- Finding the right level of abstraction can be challenging in some cases.

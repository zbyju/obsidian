Design Patterns ([[Design Patterns]]) improve code quality, maintainability and scalability of our code by improving it in terms of certain design principles ([[Design Principles]]), but they might also go against some other ones.

It is crucial to find a balance and use the design patterns only when needed as it may also cause us to slow down the development too much and add to many abstractions that will not be needed.

### Example
Many design patterns improve our code in terms of [[DRY]], [[SoC]], [[Technical Debt]] and many more; but they might also make it worse in terms of [[YAGNI]], [[KISS]] or premature optimization.

Try to find a balance of when it makes sense to use these patterns - when these patterns and what they allow us to do in the future is going to be needed and when it is too much of an abstraction to use it - yes it might solve the problem, but may make the code more complicated.

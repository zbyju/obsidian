**Definition**: YAGNI, or "You Aren't Gonna Need It," is a principle that advises against adding functionality until deemed necessary. It's a reminder to avoid overengineering.

**Example**: Instead of building a complex configuration system for an application, you'd start with a simple one and only expand when the need arises.

**Description**: YAGNI aims to keep the codebase lean, focusing on delivering what's needed now and resisting the temptation to build for perceived future requirements.

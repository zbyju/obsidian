- A behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- Facilitates the traversal of a collection and encapsulates the logic for iteration, allowing for different ways to traverse a collection.

Improves Principles:
- Open/Closed
- Single Responsibility

*Example: - In a custom data structure, such as a complex linked list or a tree, an iterator can be implemented to provide a standardized way of traversing the structure. The client code can then use this iterator to access elements sequentially without needing to understand the internal structure of the collection.*

- A design pattern where an empty interface is used to indicate or signal certain properties or behaviors of the classes that implement it.
- Commonly used for categorization or to trigger specific handling in algorithms or frameworks.

*Example: Java: the `Serializable` interface is a typical example of a marker interface. It doesn't contain any methods but marks a class as eligible for object serialization. This tells the serialization mechanism that instances of this class can be serialized without needing any additional methods.*

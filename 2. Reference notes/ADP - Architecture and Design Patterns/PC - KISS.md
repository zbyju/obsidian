**Pros**:
- Simplifies code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- Reduces the likelihood of introducing errors or bugs due to complexity.
- Encourages straightforward, efficient solutions.
- Can even make the solution faster

**Cons**:
- May lead to under-optimization in cases where complexity is necessary for performance.
- Striking the right balance between simplicity and completeness can be challenging.
- Can be interpreted as advocating for oversimplification, which may not meet all requirements.

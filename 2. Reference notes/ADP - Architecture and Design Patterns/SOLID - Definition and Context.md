**Definition**: SOLID represents five principles ensuring that software is understandable, flexible, and maintainable. It's foundational in object-oriented design.

**Example**: The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) suggests that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

**Description**: Following SOLID principles makes software designs more modular, ensuring each module or class adheres to a specific role or responsibility, making the software more robust.

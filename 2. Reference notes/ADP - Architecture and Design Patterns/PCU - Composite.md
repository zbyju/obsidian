# Pros
- Simplifies working with complex objects in a tree structure
	- Using polymorphism and recursion
- [[Open-Closed Principle]] - new elements don't break the way the existing code works

# Cons
- It might be really hard to find a common interface for classes that differ so much
	- Might lead to over abstraction

# Use Cases
- When objects can be structured into a tree
- When we need to aggregate them somehow

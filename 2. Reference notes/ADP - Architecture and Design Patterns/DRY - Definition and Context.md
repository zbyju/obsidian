**Definition**: The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle advocates for reducing repetition in code. It suggests that each piece of knowledge or logic should exist in a single, unambiguous place within a software system.

**Example**: Creating a function for a specific task and reusing it throughout the codebase instead of duplicating the same code in multiple places.

**Description**: DRY promotes maintainability by ensuring that changes or bug fixes need only be made in one location, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

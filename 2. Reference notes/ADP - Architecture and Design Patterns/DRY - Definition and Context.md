**Definition**: Don't Repeat Yourself principle advocates for reducing repetition in code. Any piece of logic/knowledge should exist in a single place within the codebase. Code should be extracted into functions/constants/etc.

**Example**: Creating a function for a specific task and reusing it throughout the codebase instead of duplicating the same code in multiple places.

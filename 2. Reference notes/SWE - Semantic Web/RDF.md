Resource Description Framework is a standard model that enables the representation of information about resources in a structured way. We can create RDF graphs to represent information.

It uses triples of **subject** - **predicate** - **object** to convey information.

There are many premade ontologies and datasets we can use:
- RDFS ([[RDF Schema]])
- OWL ([[2. Reference notes/SWE - Semantic Web/OWL|OWL]])
- SKOS ([[SKOS Ontology]])
- DBC ([[DBC Ontology]])
- FOAF ([[FOAF Ontology]])
- NIF ([[NLP Interchange Format]])

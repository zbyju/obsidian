Resource Description Framework is a standard model that enables the representation of information about resources in a structured way. We can create RDF graphs to represent information.

It uses triples of **subject** - **predicate** - **object** to convey information. These triples can be serialized in many different formats in different use cases and scenarios ([[RDF Formats]]), or even embedded into a web site ([[Web Annotations]]) and we can query this data and find patterns using SPARQL ([[2. Reference notes/SWE - Semantic Web/SPARQL|SPARQL]]).

There are many premade ontologies and datasets we can use:
- RDFS ([[RDF Schema]])
- OWL ([[2. Reference notes/SWE - Semantic Web/OWL|OWL]])
- SKOS ([[SKOS Ontology]])
- DBC ([[DBC Ontology]])
- FOAF ([[FOAF Ontology]])
- NIF ([[NLP Interchange Format]])
- Data Cube ([[RDF Data Cube]])

RDF graphs can be validated using:
- SHACL ([[SHACL]])
- ShEx ([[ShEx]])

It is a mechanism for publishing data on the web. It uses hypertext to link data together across endpoints.

It uses 4 principles:
- Use URIs for things ([[Linked Data - URI as names]])
- Use HTTP URI so that people can lookup those names ([[Linked Data - HTTP URIs]])
- Provide useful information on the URI endpoint using RDF or SPARQL ([[Linked Data - Useful Information]])
- Include links to other URIs that are relevant ([[Linked Data - Links to Other URIs]])

We can access linked data by dereferencing URI of a resource ([[Accessing Linked Data]]).

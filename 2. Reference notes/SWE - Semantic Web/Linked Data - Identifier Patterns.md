These patterns improve how our URIs look like and how usable they are.
# Patterned URI
Predictable and human-readable
Should follow some common pattern

`/collection/:id`

# Hierarchical URI
URIs should be designed around natural hierarchies and collections/groups of objects to reflect real-world hierarchy.

# Keys
## Natural keys
URIs should use some natural key that's already being used (database key, ISBN)/

## URL Slug
When there is no natural key, we can use a slug:
- Lower case
- Remove special chars
- Replace spaces with '-' or '\_'

## Shared keys
If there is already a key that's used we can use it as well, which helps linking data.

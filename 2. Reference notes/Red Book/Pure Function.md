A pure function [[Function]] is defined by its lack of side effects [[Side Effect]].

It's a function $f$ with input of type $A$ and output of type $B$ ($f: A \rightarrow B$). There can't be anything else that the function does that's observable outside the function itself.

It can also be defined using Referential Transparency ([[Referential Transparency]]). Function is pure if its application is referentially transparent for any referentially transparent arguments.

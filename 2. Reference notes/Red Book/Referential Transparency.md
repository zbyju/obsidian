Referential Transparency (RT) is a key concept, defined as the property of expressions where they can be replaced with their results without altering the program's behavior.

Expression $E$ is RT if for all programs $p$, if all occurrences of $e$ in $p$ can be replaced by the result of evaluating $e$ without affecting the meaning of $p$. 

The substitution model can help us recognize if an expression is RT.

- Atomicity
	- Transaction is either successful or fails
- Consistency
	- Write can be completed only when all they pass all constraints
- Isolation
	- Transactions don't effect each other
- Durability
	- Once the changes are confirmed they are persistently stored

ACID is very restricting and therefore pretty much forces the database to be in the "CA" category according to CAP.

Means scaling a system by adding more computational nodes.
##### Pros:
- Less expensive
- Theoretically unlimited scaling
##### Cons:
- Complex solution
- Consistency problems
- Synchronization
- Infrastracture

CAP explains the problems with horizontal scaling and the difficulties and trade-offs we have to make. We need to either choose consistency or availability.

There is no real definition of this term, but it frequently refers to databases that don't follow the traditional relational model using SQL as the query language (even though they can still use it).

They usually try to solve some specific problem traditional databases might lack in:
- Scalability
- Schema flexibility
- Ease of use

They are usually (not always) not in the "CA" category based on the CAP theorem ([[CAP Theorem]]).

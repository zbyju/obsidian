# Micro Benchmark
They focus on one specific, small-scale feature or function. They usually tend to be small and simple. They are useful for effectiveness of minor changes. Results are usually easy to interpret and straight-forward, but may be harder to apply for real-world scenarios.

# Complex Benchmark
They focus to simulate real-world database scenarios and workloads. They test the performance under defined conditions with mixture of different operations. They try to mimic real-world applications. They provide a more comprehensive and applicable view of the performance, but are harder to setup and execute.

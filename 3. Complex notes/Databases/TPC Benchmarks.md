Stands for Transaction Processing Performance Council - organization that defines and maintains a set of standardized benchmarks for evaluating database performances.

They define different benchmarking scenarios (complex benchmarks - [[Micro vs Complex Benchmarks]]) to test real-world performance.

# TPC-C
It is one of the most known benchmarks by TPC. The primary focus is on OLTP systems. It simulates a scenario of a simple eshop - making an order, payment, ...

Output:
- tpmC - transactions per minute - the number of new order transactions per minute a system can process.

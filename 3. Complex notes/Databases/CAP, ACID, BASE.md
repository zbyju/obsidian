# CAP
- Consistency
	- All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- Availability
	- Even if one or more nodes are down, any client making a request receives a response.
- Partition Tolerance
	- In spite of any number of breakdowns in communication, the cluster will continue to work.
	- = Fault tolerance

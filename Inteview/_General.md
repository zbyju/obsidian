ECG personal application for tracking emissions
1. In the middle of the semester there was a Hackathon going on on the weekend. I decided to join even if I didn't have a team but ended up finding one just few days before the start.
2. My job was the initial setup and then working on the infrastructure, which is not my main focus usually and then help with implementation.
3. On the first two days I setup the project and the infrastructure on the Google Cloud Platform. On the last day I implemented the main dashboard page of the application.
4. The project turned out great as we won first place in the hackathon due to having the application that was furthest in the development process. After 2 nights of very stressful work I was very happy I decided to participate in the competition not only because we won but also a very unique and enriching experience.

1. During my studies in Finland I took a course that made us create a web application, after the project was not moving forward at all.
2. Our goal was to create a geofencing application where the application tracks a user inside a polygon on a map and calculates different metrics.
3. I took the initiative and implemented the center of the application - the custom polygon creation and the map tracking.
4. I was happy to inspire my teammates to work on the project and we eneded up getting an A for the project.

1. At my previous work there was an inquiry about the temperatures inside the babybox during freezing temperatures as the babybox had a faulty component and they wanted to make sure it was because of the component and not a bad heating system in general.
   I have just finished deploying the new version of our monitoring application and didn't have the long term data.
4. My goal was to file a report for the hospital about the temperatures under different conditions.
5. Fortunately, I was able to recover the data from the old application and mine the needed data out to create a comprehensive report of how the babybox temperatures during freezing temperatures and cool down during higher temperatures.
6. This resulted in the hospital agreeing to mark the babybox as safe to operate again.

I found about myself that I really enjoy working in a dynamic international team with cultural diversity.

I like that the more casual setting without the slow corporate decision making.

I really like the tech stack that matches my passions and I think I would be a great fit.

My dad has a company with many trucks and so I can somewhat relate to how useful applications for managing and optimizing fleets can be.



Dear CÃ©line,

Thank you for considering my application. Here are my answers:

1. Hash map stores values based on a key. The index of a key is calculated using a hash function. The main advantage is that it can do lookups, inserts and deletes usually in O(1) time complexity, which is the main advantage over regular arrays, or self-balancing binary trees.
2. I just recently finished reading "Architecture Patterns with Python", which discusses many approaches of architecture design starting from domain modeling, domain driven design, test driven development, Event-driven architecture and more. Although the book uses Python it explains everything in a general manner applicable to any codebase. This book made me think differently about approaching bigger projects and designing a good solution.
3. My strong suite is definitely in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem ranging from the frontend where I have the most experience with technologies like React, Next.js (with a combination with other tools such as Tailwind, Shadcn, npm/yarn/pnpm) or even Vue.js, Svelte, Astro; and also on the backend with Node.js, but also have experience with Java/Scala, Go, Python and more; I would love to learn Kotlin and Rust in the future. I like coming up with creative but simple solutions and enjoy problem solving. My main weakness is my confidence and sometimes trying too hard to make everything perfect which I'm trying to work on.
4. Yes, I am aware
5. Yes, I would be happy to relocate to Basel. I'm currently based in Czechia, I'm an EU citizen.
6. I would expect salary in the range of 65000-80000 depending on the full compensation package.
7. I can start as soon as possible depending on the relocation.

I would also like to ask about the fourth step of the hiring process, would it be possible for it to take place online, or is it mandatory for me to come on-site?

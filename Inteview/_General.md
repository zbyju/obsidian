ECG personal application for tracking emissions
1. In the middle of the semester there was a Hackathon going on on the weekend. I decided to join even if I didn't have a team but ended up finding one just few days before the start.
2. My job was the initial setup and then working on the infrastructure, which is not my main focus usually and then help with implementation.
3. On the first two days I setup the project and the infrastructure on the Google Cloud Platform. On the last day I implemented the main dashboard page of the application.
4. The project turned out great as we won first place in the hackathon due to having the application that was furthest in the development process. After 2 nights of very stressful work I was very happy I decided to participate in the competition not only because we won but also a very unique and enriching experience.

1. During my studies in Finland I took a course that made us create a web application, after the project was not moving forward at all.
2. Our goal was to create a geofencing application where the application tracks a user inside a polygon on a map and calculates different metrics.
3. I took the initiative and implemented the center of the application - the custom polygon creation and the map tracking.
4. I was happy to inspire my teammates to work on the project and we eneded up getting an A for the project.

1. At my previous work there was an inquiry about the temperatures inside the babybox during freezing temperatures as the babybox had a faulty component and they wanted to make sure it was because of the component and not a bad heating system in general.
   I have just finished deploying the new version of our monitoring application and didn't have the long term data.
4. My goal was to file a report for the hospital about the temperatures under different conditions.
5. Fortunately, I was able to recover the data from the old application and mine the needed data out to create a comprehensive report of how the babybox temperatures during freezing temperatures and cool down during higher temperatures.
6. This resulted in the hospital agreeing to mark the babybox as safe to operate again.

I found about myself that I really enjoy working in a dynamic international team with cultural diversity.

I like that the more casual setting without the slow corporate decision making.

I really like the tech stack that matches my passions and I think I would be a great fit.

My dad has a company with many trucks and so I can somewhat relate to how useful applications for managing and optimizing fleets can be.

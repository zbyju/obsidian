Attribute translation CFG
Semantic evaluations in syntax-directed translation

every symbol (non-terminal, terminal, output symbol) of a CFG can have an attribute

an attribute x of a symbol A is written A.x (dot notation)
that the values of attributes are defined by attribute (semantic) rules
each semantic rule is associated with just one syntactic rule

Example:

Syntax:
1. S -> aSb
2. S -> eps

Semantics:
1.

# Chapter 1
Result != Quality of the decision
2 Mode of thinking:
- fast
- slow

## What is a bet?
Decision about an uncertain future

Treating decisions as bets make it possible to find learning opportunities in uncertain environments. Treating decisions as bets helps:
- avoid common decision traps
- learn from results in a more rational way
- keep emotions out of the process as much as possible
- overtime it improves decision making

## How to think in bets?
There are 2 things that determine an outcome:
- Quality of the decision
- Luck

Life is more like poker - decisions + luck, not like chess - pure calculation.

During the Super Bowl in 2015, the coach Pete Carroll made a call that was questionable and it didn't work out. They lost the game. Everybody said they it was the worst play in NHL history. According to statistics it was a good call, but they just got unlucky.
The headlines would change to brilliant if it did work out. People don't think about the decision itself but the result that came from that decision.
A fair headline would be the worst result of a call ever. People are just bad at separating luck and skill.

Just because something turned out well doesn't mean the decision was good.
Just because something turned out poorly doesn't mean the decision was bad.

Another problem is the hindsight bias. When we know the result of a decision we have more information and then we know how we should've made that decision (or have a better idea).

Stop classifying decision as good or bad based on the result.
If you drive home drunk and you make it home safely, you wouldn't think that it was a good decision.

Famous people werent born already being masters at what they are good at
They worked towards taht goal

Society rewards people that achieve things
But that's not a good mindset

It is better to have the growth mindset
- = trying to grow as a person towards your goals instead
- skill isnt fixed and can be improved
- it leads to better performance
- better motivation
- better relationship with stress and challenges

different types of skill profiles:
- I - deep skill in one area
- T - breadth + deep
- $\Pi$ - breadth + deep in more areas
- X - breadth + depth + diversity and ablity to stretch into more domains
	- This is what we want
	- Can't achieve with fixed mindset

Fixed mindset:
- attached to fixed characteristics/labels
	- I am smart, intelligent, hardworking
	- Identified with nouns/adjectives
- Avoid challenge/obstacles/effort
	- We still want to continue to look smart
- success of others is a threat

Growth mindset:
- attached to the effort 
	- I study a lot of math
	- Identified with verbs
- challnges/obstacles/effort lead to growth
- success of others can be a lesson


Words matter
- **YET**
	- I am not good at something YET

Growth mindset doesnt come by itself
- we need to push ourselves
- get out of the comfort zone


Design project:

1. Identify an area
	- Where you want to grow?
2. Set a goal
	- Where do you want to go?
3. Identify challenges
	- What will come in the way?
4. Design creatively
	- How might we overcome the challenges?
5. Plan your project
	- What, how, when, who else 

1. identify areas of life where you have a growth mindset and where you have a fixed mindset
	- Develop a persona for your fixed mindset
		- When do they come up?
2. Setup a goal that can be measured
	- It needs to be challenging but not too much
		- Stretch yourself but not snap

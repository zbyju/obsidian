Famous people werent born already being masters at what they are good at
They worked towards taht goal

Society rewards people that achieve things
But that's not a good mindset

It is better to have the growth mindset
- = trying to grow as a person towards your goals instead
- skill isnt fixed and can be improved
- it leads to better performance
- better motivation
- better relationship with stress and challenges

different types of skill profiles:
- I - deep skill in one area
- T - breadth + deep
- $\Pi$ - breadth + deep in more areas
- X - breadth + depth + diversity and ablity to stretch into more domains
	- This is what we want
	- Can't achieve with fixed mindset

Fixed mindset:
- attached to fixed characteristics/labels
	- I am smart, intelligent, hardworking
	- Identified with nouns/adjectives
- Avoid challenge/obstacles/effort
	- We still want to continue to look smart
- success of others is a threat

Growth mindset:
- attached to the effort 
	- I study a lot of math
	- Identified with verbs
- challnges/obstacles/effort lead to growth
- success of others can be a lesson


Words matter
- **YET**
	- I am not good at something YET

Growth mindset doesnt come by itself
- we need to push ourselves
- get out of the comfort zone


Design project:

1. Identify an area
	- Where you want to grow?
2. Set a goal
	- Where do you want to go?
3. Identify challenges
	- What will come in the way?
4. Design creatively
	- How might we overcome the challenges?
5. Plan your project
	- What, how, when, who else 

1. identify areas of life where you have a growth mindset and where you have a fixed mindset
	- Develop a persona for your fixed mindset
		- When do they come up?
2. Setup a goal that can be measured
	- It needs to be challenging but not too much
		- Stretch yourself but not snap
3. Identify potential problems
	- Use the inversion method
	- Come up with strategies for each challenge (preferably multiple)
	- Then push the ideas further and come up with crazy creative ideas
	- Who else can help me with this task
	- Where else can we inspire from
	- How can we push this further
	- If i had to turn this into a business what would that look like
4. design the path forward based on the goal and the obstacles
	- be creative in preventing the obstacles
	- how can i achieve the things i want
	- how else can i approach this
	- how to be crazy
	- how can i push this further
5. actually plan it out
	- how to start
	- timeline
	- plan for failure


Inversion method
Instead of thinking how to accomplish something it's better to think about how to fail and avoid the failure
Identify obstacles, barriers, challenges and how to solve them
- They can be internal (motivation, skill, ...)
- external

Best pracices:
1. Failure
	- Expected
	- Treat them as opportunities to learn and pivot
2. Don't be a lone warrior
	- Get feedback and insights
3. Keep the creativity and have fun
4. Focus on progress not perfection
5. Listen to the voice in your head
6. Commitment over Confidence

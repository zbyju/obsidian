AI is just a small part of some process

It's nice to have nice AI for something but if it doesnt trigger some action there is actually no value.



Every startup needs:
1. Desirebility
2. Technology (it is possible)


The value needs to be there. Doesnt matter what the idea is but it needs to solve a problem and provide value
